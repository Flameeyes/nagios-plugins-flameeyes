Flameeyes's custom Nagios/Icinga plugins
========================================

This repository has been created because I feel the need for more
structure to push my personal Nagios plugins than just publishing them
to a website, and because I feel that there is no reason why I should
keep said plugins all by myself.

Please feel free to fork and send pull request for any enhacement or
fix you come up with.

License
-------

Each plugin will provide its own license header to make it clear under
which license it's released under. Most of them you'll see having a
MIT license, which basically is an all-permissive license. If
different licenses are used, it's usually because the plugin is
derived from another one that was published under a different license.
